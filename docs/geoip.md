# IP Geolocation

Traefik Manager can resolve client IP addresses to countries and show them in the [Logs](tab-logs.md) and [CrowdSec](tab-crowdsec.md) tabs - a country flag on every IP, a **Geography** panel with a shaded **world map** and a ranked country list, either of which you can click to filter.

::: tip Privacy
All lookups happen **on the server against a local database**. IP addresses are never sent to any third-party geolocation API, there are no per-request network calls, and it keeps working offline. Only the database file itself is downloaded (once a month) from DB-IP.
:::

## Enabling it

The first-run setup wizard offers this on its Monitoring step. Afterwards:

1. Open **Settings → Interface → Geolocation** and turn on **IP geolocation**.
2. TM downloads the free country database automatically. You can also click **Download / Update** at any time to refresh it.

That's it - open the Logs or CrowdSec tab and IPs will show their country.

## What you get

- **Logs tab** - a flag next to each client IP, the country in the log detail panel, and a Geography panel pairing the world map with a ranked country list. Click a country on either to filter the log entries.
- **CrowdSec tab** - a country flag on every alert row, and the same Geography panel showing where the attacking sources are. Click a country to filter the whole tab. CrowdSec usually resolves the country itself, so the host database is only consulted when the reporting agent did not enrich its alerts, and never for the decisions list.

Remote agents are covered automatically - the Host performs the lookups on the data it fetches from each agent, so no agent-side configuration is needed.

## The database

By default TM uses the free **[DB-IP Lite](https://db-ip.com) IP-to-Country** database:

- **License:** CC-BY 4.0 - the only requirement is the visible "IP Geolocation by DB-IP" credit shown in the app.
- **Size:** ~4 MB, country-level.
- **Updates:** published monthly; TM refreshes it automatically (and on demand from Settings).
- **Download:** keyless, no account needed.

The database is stored at `CONFIG_DIR/geoip/dbip-country-lite.mmdb`.

### Using your own database

Point the `GEOIP_DB_PATH` environment variable at any MaxMind DB format (`.mmdb`) file and TM will read that instead - for example a MaxMind GeoLite2 or a paid DB-IP database:

```yaml
environment:
  - GEOIP_DB_PATH=/data/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb
volumes:
  - /path/to/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb:/data/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb:ro
```

When `GEOIP_DB_PATH` is set, the built-in DB-IP auto-download is not used.

## Settings reference

| Setting | Where | Description |
|---|---|---|
| IP geolocation | Settings → Interface → Geolocation, or `geoip_enabled` in `manager.yml` | Master on/off toggle (off by default) |
| `GEOIP_DB_PATH` | Environment variable, or `geoip_db_path` in `manager.yml` | Path to a custom `.mmdb`; overrides the built-in DB-IP download |

## Notes

- Private and internal IP ranges are not in the country database, so they simply show no flag.
- Geolocation is country-level. City-level accuracy is not needed for the map and keeps the database small.
- Turning the feature off removes the flags, map, and Country columns on the next refresh.

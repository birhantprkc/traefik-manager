# Traefik Manager Agent (TMA)

TMA is a lightweight Go daemon that runs alongside Traefik on a remote server. It exposes an HTTP API on port 8090 that lets a central Traefik Manager instance manage the remote server's routes, config files, backups, and more - without needing direct access to the Traefik API or config files.

## How it works

1. Install TMA on each remote server (alongside Traefik)
2. In TM Settings - Agents, click **Add Agent** and enter the agent's URL
3. TM generates an API key - save it and set it as `TMA_API_KEY` in the agent's environment
4. Use the **server switcher** in the TM navigation bar to switch between the Host and remote servers

Each agent card in Settings - Agents has four action buttons:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| Key icon | Manage API keys for this agent |
| Pencil icon | Rename the agent - click to edit inline, Enter or click the checkmark to save |
| Gear icon | Edit agent settings (Traefik config, paths, restart method, git backup, CrowdSec) |
| Trash icon | Remove the agent from TM (does not affect the agent service on the remote server) |

When a remote agent is active:

- **Routes** - The Routes tab shows the agent's routes fetched live from the remote Traefik instance. You can add, edit, delete, and toggle routes exactly as you would locally - changes are written to the agent's config files and a `.bak` backup is created before every write. The Config File selector in the Add/Edit Route form lists the agent's actual config files (fetched live), not the Host's config files. If the agent has **Domains** configured (Settings - Agents - Traefik tab) or existing routes to detect domains from, the Add/Edit Route form shows domain chip selectors - the same experience as the Host, including domains auto-detected from the agent's routes and a **+** chip for ad-hoc entry. Without any domains, the Subdomain field becomes a free-form **Hostname** field (enter the full hostname, e.g. `app.example.com`). Entrypoints in the route form are fetched live from the agent's Traefik instance. The **Security headers** and **Optimize for streaming** presets are available on agents too - the generated middleware and `serversTransport` are written to that agent's own config. Cert resolvers offered in the route form are detected automatically from the agent's Traefik API - any resolver already used by one of that server's routers is offered, so no extra configuration is needed. Resolvers found in the agent's static config are merged in when it is mounted, and the optional **Certificate Resolver** field (Settings - Agents - Traefik tab) lets you add resolver names that aren't in use by any route yet.
- **Middlewares** - The Middlewares tab shows only middlewares managed by TM - those in config files under `CONFIG_PATH` with the `@file` provider suffix. Traefik built-in and other provider middlewares are excluded from the badge count and the chip selector. You can add and edit middlewares on the agent exactly as you would locally.
- **Services** - Shows the agent's services from the remote Traefik API.
- **Route Map** - The route map diagram renders the agent's routes and services.
- **Tab visibility** - Provider and monitoring tab toggles (Docker, Kubernetes, Certs, Plugins, etc.) are stored per-server in the browser. Changes made while on an agent do not affect the Host or other agents.
- **Static Config tab** - Available if the agent has `STATIC_CONFIG_PATH` set and `traefik.yml` mounted read-write. With that agent selected in the server switcher, the Off / Settings / Tab choice appears under **Settings - Interface** and it offers the same section editing as the Host: entrypoint, cert resolver, plugin and provider cards, the API/log panels, the trusted-IPs helper and the raw YAML editor. Changes are staged and written to the agent's file on save, with a `.bak` backup first. Traefik restart after save works if the agent has `RESTART_METHOD` configured. See [Static config editing](#static-config-editing).
- **Plugins tab** - Lists and manages the plugins declared under `experimental.plugins` in the agent's static config (requires `STATIC_CONFIG_PATH`). Install from a pasted snippet, edit and remove all work against the agent's `traefik.yml`; a generated middleware snippet is written to the agent config file you pick in the install form (default `plugin-middlewares.yml`).
- **Backups** (Settings - Backups) - Shows the agent's local `.bak` backup files. The agent creates a `.bak` automatically before every config write; you can also create a manual backup at any time. In the Git sub-tab you can enable **Use Host Repository** to have the Host push this agent's config to the Host's git repository on a dedicated branch (no agent-side git config needed), or leave the agent autonomous via its `GIT_BACKUP_*` env vars. The Static Config backup sub-tab is not shown for agents.
- **Logs** - The Logs tab shows the agent's access log when `ACCESS_LOG_PATH` is set on the agent. When installed via the installer script alongside Traefik, this is set automatically.
- **Certificates** - The Certificates tab shows certs from the agent's `acme.json` when `ACME_JSON_PATH` is set. When installed via the installer script alongside Traefik, this is set automatically.
- **CrowdSec** - If the agent has `CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL` plus a bouncer key, machine credentials, or both, the CrowdSec tab shows that server's attack surface: who is hitting it, from which networks, which scenarios fired, what they were going after, and the bans in force. The Host does not need any access to that CrowdSec instance - every call is proxied through the agent. See [CrowdSec on an agent](#crowdsec-on-an-agent).
- **Settings sidebar** - When an agent is active, only agent-relevant Settings panels are shown: Backups, Route Monitoring tab toggles, Static Config (if configured), System Monitoring tab toggles (Tab Visibility and File Paths only), and Templates. Authentication, Connection, Notifications, and the CrowdSec credentials sub-tab are hidden - they only apply to the Host. CrowdSec on an agent is configured with env vars on the agent itself, not from the Host UI.

## Install via installer script

The fastest way is to use the `traefik-stack` installer with the agent option pre-selected:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get-traefik.xyzlab.dev | bash
```

Choose **Traefik Manager Agent** from the menu. Or, to skip the menu entirely:

```bash
export TMA_INSTALL=1
curl -fsSL https://get-traefik.xyzlab.dev | bash
```

The installer uses an arrow-key menu and a review screen - type a section number to go back and edit it, or press Enter to proceed. It covers all options including:

- **Install method** - Docker agent only, Docker agent + Traefik (deploys both), or binary (systemd)
- **Traefik connection** - API URL, config path, static config mount, and TLS skip-verify (prompted automatically when URL is `https://`)
- **Traefik install** (Agent + Traefik mode) - TLS method, Let's Encrypt email, Cloudflare token, dashboard hostname, network name
- **CrowdSec** - install alongside the agent (Docker only) or connect to an existing instance
- **Git backup**, **optional paths**, **restart method**, **install location**

## Install via Docker manually

```yaml
services:
  traefik-manager-agent:
    image: ghcr.io/chr0nzz/traefik-manager-agent:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "8090:8090"
    environment:
      - TMA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
      - TRAEFIK_API_URL=http://traefik:8080
      - CONFIG_PATH=/app/config
      # Optional - enable static config editing:
      - STATIC_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/traefik/traefik.yml
      # Optional - enable Traefik restart:
      - RESTART_METHOD=proxy
      - TRAEFIK_CONTAINER=traefik
      - DOCKER_HOST=tcp://socket-proxy:2375
      # Optional - enable the CrowdSec tab for this server:
      - CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL=http://crowdsec:8080
      - CROWDSEC_API_KEY=your-bouncer-api-key
      - CROWDSEC_MACHINE_ID=traefik-manager
      - CROWDSEC_MACHINE_PASSWORD=your-machine-password
    volumes:
      - /host/config:/app/config
      # Required by STATIC_CONFIG_PATH above. Must be the same traefik.yml Traefik
      # itself reads, and must be writable - no :ro
      - /etc/traefik/traefik.yml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yml
      - tma_backups:/app/backups

volumes:
  tma_backups:
```

> **Backup persistence**: Always include the `tma_backups` named volume (or a bind mount to a host path via `BACKUP_DIR`). Without it, all backup files stored in `/app/backups` are lost when the container is recreated (e.g. on image update). The Settings - Agents wizard generates this volume automatically.

## Static config editing

Two additions to the agent service enable the **Static Config** tab for that server: the env var, and a volume that actually puts the file inside the agent container.

```yaml
services:
  traefik-manager-agent:
    environment:
      - STATIC_CONFIG_PATH=/etc/traefik/traefik.yml
    volumes:
      - /etc/traefik/traefik.yml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yml
```

The two must agree: `STATIC_CONFIG_PATH` is the path **inside the agent container**, which is the right-hand side of the volume. Mount it wherever you like, as long as the env var names the same place.

The left-hand side is the host path, and it must be the very file your Traefik reads. If Traefik runs in Docker, use the same host path its own compose mounts:

```yaml
services:
  traefik:
    volumes:
      - /srv/traefik/traefik.yml:/traefik.yml:ro      # Traefik reads it here

  traefik-manager-agent:
    environment:
      - STATIC_CONFIG_PATH=/traefik.yml
    volumes:
      - /srv/traefik/traefik.yml:/traefik.yml          # agent edits the same file
```

Note the paths inside the two containers do not have to match - only the host path does. Traefik may keep its copy read-only; the agent's must not be.

- The mount must be **writable** - no `:ro`. A `.bak` backup is created in `BACKUP_DIR` before every save. Single-file bind mounts are supported.
- The path is wherever you mount the file inside the **agent** container - it does not have to match the path inside the Traefik container.
- The tab toggle only appears under **Settings - Interface** while that agent is the active server, and only when the agent reports the file as readable. Recreate the agent after adding the env var, then check again.
- To restart Traefik after a save, set `RESTART_METHOD` on the agent. `proxy` needs `TRAEFIK_CONTAINER` plus `DOCKER_HOST` pointing at a docker socket proxy (e.g. `tcp://socket-proxy:2375`) with `CONTAINERS=1` and `POST=1`, reachable from the agent's network.
- Agents get the full section editing experience - entrypoints, cert resolvers, plugins, providers, API/log panels, trusted-IPs helper and the raw YAML editor - identical to the Host.
- Setting `STATIC_CONFIG_PATH` also enables plugin management in the agent's **Plugins** tab.

## CrowdSec on an agent

Each agent talks to its own CrowdSec LAPI. The Host never connects to it - every request is proxied through the agent - so a CrowdSec that only listens on a private network is fine, and each server shows its own attacks under its own entry in the server switcher.

Point the agent at the LAPI and give it credentials:

```yaml
services:
  traefik-manager-agent:
    environment:
      - CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL=http://crowdsec:8080
      - CROWDSEC_API_KEY=your-bouncer-api-key
      - CROWDSEC_MACHINE_ID=traefik-manager
      - CROWDSEC_MACHINE_PASSWORD=your-machine-password
    networks:
      - traefik-net
```

### Generating the credentials

Run both on the machine hosting CrowdSec. In Docker, prefix with `docker exec <crowdsec-container>`.

```bash
cscli bouncers add traefik-manager
cscli machines add traefik-manager --auto
cat /etc/crowdsec/local_api_credentials.yaml
```

The bouncer key is printed once - copy it immediately into `CROWDSEC_API_KEY`. The machine's `login` and `password` come from that credentials file and go into `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_ID` and `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_PASSWORD`. If the machine shows as unvalidated, run `cscli machines validate traefik-manager`.

### What each credential gets you

The two are complementary, not tiered, because CrowdSec accepts each on different endpoints. You can set either one alone and the tab will say plainly what it cannot see:

| Configured | What the CrowdSec tab shows |
|---|---|
| Bouncer key only | Bans in force, and the decisions view. No alerts, so no attacking sources, networks, scenarios, paths or tooling |
| Machine credentials only | The full attack surface from alerts, but no ban state - sources are reported as *unknown* rather than guessed as unbanned |
| Both | Everything, including unbanning from the UI and adding manual decisions |

### Notes

- The tab is enabled per server. With the agent active, toggle **CrowdSec** under **Settings - Interface**.
- The agent must be able to reach the LAPI. If CrowdSec runs as a systemd service on the agent's host rather than in Docker, see the `host.docker.internal` and firewall notes under [CrowdSec environment variables](#crowdsec).
- If the agent cannot reach the LAPI at all, the tab says so rather than reporting zero decisions as fact.
- Escape a `$` in the machine password as `$$` in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Install via binary

Download the binary for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/chr0nzz/traefik-manager/releases) page (`tma-linux-amd64`, `tma-linux-arm64`, etc.) and create a systemd unit:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Traefik Manager Agent
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment=TMA_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Environment=TRAEFIK_API_URL=http://traefik:8080
Environment=CONFIG_PATH=/app/config
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/tma
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now tma
```

## Environment variables

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `TMA_API_KEY` | API key generated in TM Settings - Agents |

### Traefik connection

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TRAEFIK_API_URL` | `http://traefik:8080` | Traefik API URL. Use `http://traefik:8080` when TMA runs alongside Traefik on the same Docker network, or a public HTTPS URL for a remote Traefik instance. |
| `TRAEFIK_API_USER` | - | Username for a Traefik API behind basic auth. Set together with `TRAEFIK_API_PASSWORD`; when both are set the agent sends HTTP Basic Auth on every Traefik API call. Leave empty for an unauthenticated API. |
| `TRAEFIK_API_PASSWORD` | - | Password paired with `TRAEFIK_API_USER`. |
| `TRAEFIK_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` | `false` | Skip TLS certificate verification for HTTPS Traefik API URLs. Useful when using a self-signed cert or Cloudflare Origin Certificate. |
| `CONFIG_PATH` | `/app/config` | Dynamic config directory or file. This is the **only** config-location variable the agent has - see the note below |
| `STATIC_CONFIG_PATH` | - | Path to `traefik.yml` - enables static config R/W |

::: warning CONFIG_DIR and CONFIG_PATHS are Host-only
The agent reads **`CONFIG_PATH` only**. `CONFIG_DIR` and `CONFIG_PATHS`, which the Host supports, do not exist in the agent and are ignored if you set them.

`CONFIG_PATH` covers both cases on its own:

```ini
# a directory - every .yml/.yaml file directly inside it is managed
Environment=CONFIG_PATH=/etc/traefik/conf.d

# or a single file
Environment=CONFIG_PATH=/etc/traefik/dynamic.yml
```

A directory is read **one level deep**, not recursively. Point it at the folder that actually holds your router files: pointing at a parent like `/etc/traefik` picks up `traefik.yml` (your *static* config, which has no routers) and never descends into `conf.d`, so the Routes and Middlewares tabs come back empty with no error.
:::

### Optional paths

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ACME_JSON_PATH` | - | Path to `acme.json` - enables cert info reads. Accepts several files comma-separated, or a directory whose `.json` files are all read (Traefik writes one storage file per cert resolver). |
| `ACCESS_LOG_PATH` | - | Path to Traefik access log file |
| `PLUGINS_DIR` | - | Path to Traefik plugins directory |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `/app/backups` | Directory where local `.bak` backup files are stored |
| `BACKUP_KEEP_COUNT` | `0` | Keep only the last N `.bak` files per config file (0 = keep all) |

### Traefik restart

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `RESTART_METHOD` | - | `proxy`, `poison-pill`, or `socket` |
| `TRAEFIK_CONTAINER` | `traefik` | Container name (used by `proxy` and `socket` methods) |
| `DOCKER_HOST` | - | e.g. `tcp://socket-proxy:2375` (used by `proxy` method) |
| `SIGNAL_FILE_PATH` | - | e.g. `/signals/restart.sig` (used by `poison-pill` method) |

### CrowdSec

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL` | - | CrowdSec LAPI URL (e.g. `http://crowdsec:8080`) |
| `CROWDSEC_API_KEY` | - | CrowdSec bouncer API key - used to read **decisions** (active bans/captchas/bypasses) |
| `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_ID` | - | CrowdSec machine login - required to read **alerts** and to unban (delete decisions) |
| `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_PASSWORD` | - | Password for the machine login |
| `CROWDSEC_CLIENT_CERT` | - | Path to a TLS client certificate for a LAPI behind mTLS, replaces the API key and machine login |
| `CROWDSEC_CLIENT_KEY` | - | Path to the client certificate's private key |
| `CROWDSEC_CA_CERT` | - | Path to the CA certificate that signed the LAPI's own certificate (private PKI) |
| `CROWDSEC_READ_TIMEOUT` | `20` | Seconds to wait for the LAPI to answer. Raise it on a busy or large LAPI |
| `CROWDSEC_ALERT_LIMIT` | `500` | How many of the most recent alerts to read. `0` reads every alert, which is slow on a large LAPI |

**Two credential types - why both?**

CrowdSec's LAPI uses two different authentication methods for different endpoints:

- **Bouncer key** (`CROWDSEC_API_KEY`) can read the active **decisions** list. This is all you need to see and filter bans, captchas, and bypasses in the CrowdSec tab.
- **Machine credentials** (`CROWDSEC_MACHINE_ID` + `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_PASSWORD`) are required to read the **alerts** list and to **unban** (delete a decision). Bouncer keys cannot access these endpoints - the LAPI returns `403 access forbidden` or an empty result.

Set both for the full CrowdSec tab. They are complementary, not tiered: the machine token is refused on `/v1/decisions` and the bouncer key is refused on `/v1/alerts`. With only the bouncer key you get the bans in force and nothing about who attacked you.

**LAPI behind mutual TLS?** Set `CROWDSEC_CLIENT_CERT`, `CROWDSEC_CLIENT_KEY` and `CROWDSEC_CA_CERT` instead (paths as mounted inside the agent container, add the files as read-only volumes). One client certificate covers decisions and alerts when its OU is listed in both `bouncers_allowed_ou` and `agents_allowed_ou`, and the LAPI auto-provisions the bouncer and machine on first contact - no key or password needed.

**Creating a machine login:**

On the CrowdSec host, register a machine and let CrowdSec generate the credentials:

```bash
sudo cscli machines add traefik-manager --auto
sudo cat /etc/crowdsec/local_api_credentials.yaml
```

Copy the `login` and `password` from that file into `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_ID` and `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_PASSWORD`. If the machine shows as unvalidated, run `sudo cscli machines validate traefik-manager`.

> **Compose gotcha**: if the generated password contains a `$`, escape it as `$$` in `docker-compose.yml` (Docker Compose treats a single `$` as a variable reference). No escaping is needed for a Docker `run` command or a systemd unit.

**If CrowdSec runs as a systemd service on the same host as the agent:**

The agent container cannot reach `127.0.0.1` on the host directly. Use `host.docker.internal` instead and add `extra_hosts` to the agent service:

```yaml
services:
  traefik-manager-agent:
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    environment:
      - CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8070
```

You also need to allow the agent's Docker network subnet to reach the CrowdSec LAPI port through the host firewall. Find the subnet and add the rule:

```bash
docker network inspect <your-network> | grep Subnet
sudo ufw allow from <subnet> to any port <crowdsec-port> proto tcp
```

### Git backup

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GIT_BACKUP_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable autonomous git backup |
| `GIT_BACKUP_REPO` | - | HTTPS git repository URL |
| `GIT_BACKUP_BRANCH` | `main` | Branch to push to |
| `GIT_BACKUP_USERNAME` | - | Git username |
| `GIT_BACKUP_TOKEN` | - | Git access token |
| `GIT_BACKUP_COMMIT_MESSAGE` | `traefik-manager: {action} at {timestamp}` | Commit message template |
| `GIT_BACKUP_AUTO_PUSH` | `true` | Push after every config write |

::: warning
Do not point multiple servers (Host or agents) at the same repository and branch - they push to the same file paths and will overwrite each other. Use a separate repository or a distinct `GIT_BACKUP_BRANCH` per server (e.g. `agent-vps1`). See [Git Repository Backup](git-backup.md).
:::

::: tip Prefer Host-managed backup
Instead of configuring `GIT_BACKUP_*` on every agent, you can enable **Use Host Repository** in Settings - Backups - Git while the agent is active: the Host pushes the agent's config to its own repository on a per-agent branch, using the Host's credentials.
:::

### Agent server

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TMA_PORT` | `8090` | Listening port |
| `TMA_RATE_LIMIT` | `300` | Requests per minute per IP (0 = disabled) |
| `TMA_DEBUG` | `false` | When `true`, log each failed Traefik API call (the request URL and the returned status) to the journal. Off by default; the agent otherwise only logs startup and fatal errors. Turn it on when a tab shows "could not load" and you need to see why (for example a `401` from an authenticated API). |

`TMA_PORT` and `TMA_RATE_LIMIT` can also be set from the **Settings - Agents** wizard. They appear as optional fields in the configuration step; leave them blank to use the defaults. The generated Docker Compose only includes these env vars when a non-default value is entered.

### Domains (TM-side, not an env var)

The **Domains** field in Settings - Agents (Traefik tab) is a TM-side configuration - it is not passed to the agent container. It tells TM what domains are available on this agent when creating or editing routes. Enter one or more domains separated by commas (e.g. `example.com, example.net`). Domains found in the agent's existing routes are added to the route form automatically, so this field is optional seeding. When the agent has no configured domains and no routes to detect them from, the Subdomain field becomes a free-form Hostname field for the full hostname.

## Storage

Agent registrations (name, URL, encrypted API key, and configuration) are stored in `agents.yml` in the same config directory as `manager.yml` (default `/app/config/agents.yml`). The file is created automatically when the first agent is added. If you are upgrading from a version before v1.5.0, agents are migrated automatically from `manager.yml` to `agents.yml` on first start - no manual action required.

Back up `agents.yml` alongside `manager.yml` to preserve agent registrations.

## Security

- The API key is the only credential - keep it secret and use HTTPS between TM and TMA
- Put TMA behind a reverse proxy (Traefik itself) with TLS for production use
- `TMA_RATE_LIMIT` defaults to 300 req/min - TM makes many API calls per tab switch so the default is intentionally generous; lower it only if you need to restrict access
- The `/health` endpoint is public (no auth required) - use it for uptime monitoring

## Updating

**Docker:**
```bash
cd /opt/traefik-manager-agent
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

**Binary:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/chr0nzz/traefik-manager/releases/latest/download/tma-linux-amd64 \
  -o /usr/local/bin/tma && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/tma
sudo systemctl restart tma
```

## Agent git backup

When `GIT_BACKUP_ENABLED=true`, the agent handles its own git backup cycle autonomously using the `GIT_BACKUP_*` env vars. You do not configure agent git backup through the TM Settings UI - the Settings - Agents wizard generates the Docker Compose with all env vars pre-filled based on your inputs.

When an agent is active in the TM server switcher, Settings - Backups shows the agent's backup data:

- **Dynamic Config tab** - lists and restores the agent's local `.bak` backups. The agent automatically creates a `.bak` file before every config write (route or middleware save), so changes can always be rolled back. Manual "Create Backup" backs up all config files at once. Backup files are named `filename.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.bak` and stored in `BACKUP_DIR`.
- **Git tab** - shows the agent's git history, status, and allows manual push and git restore; git configuration fields are hidden (managed by env vars on the agent)
- **Static Config tab** - not shown for agents (static config is part of the regular backup)

See [API Reference - Agent](api-agent.md) for the full endpoint list.

## Troubleshooting

**Switched to an agent but the Routes/Services tabs are empty ("No routes found")**

This almost always means the agent container can reach Traefik Manager, but the **agent itself cannot reach its Traefik API**. Routes from the Docker, Kubernetes, and other providers come from the Traefik API, so if `TRAEFIK_API_URL` is wrong or unreachable from inside the agent container, those routes all disappear. The Routes tab shows a banner with the exact connection error (e.g. `traefik unavailable at http://traefik:8080: connection refused`).

Check the agent's `TRAEFIK_API_URL`:

- It must be reachable **from inside the agent container**. `http://traefik:8080` only works when the agent shares Traefik's Docker network; from a different host or network, point it at the Traefik API's reachable address.
- Traefik's API must be enabled (`--api=true`) and listening where the URL points.
- Test it from the agent host: `docker exec <agent-container> wget -qO- http://traefik:8080/api/http/routers` - it should return JSON.

For HTTPS Traefik API URLs with a self-signed or Cloudflare Origin certificate, set `TRAEFIK_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true`.

**The Traefik API is behind basic auth (returns `401`)**

If your Traefik API sits behind a `basicAuth` middleware or a protected dashboard route, every agent call comes back `traefik returned status 401` and the tabs show "could not load". Either point `TRAEFIK_API_URL` at the internal, unauthenticated API (usually `http://localhost:8080` with `api.insecure: true` bound to localhost, on the same host as Traefik), or keep the authenticated URL and give the agent credentials:

```
TRAEFIK_API_USER=youruser
TRAEFIK_API_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```

When both are set the agent sends HTTP Basic Auth on every Traefik API call. The setup wizard also asks for these when you tell it the Traefik API is behind basic auth.

**Viewing the agent's logs (binary install)**

The binary install runs the agent as a systemd service, so its output is in the journal, not a file:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u tma -n 200 --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u tma -f
```

By default the agent only logs its startup line and fatal errors - per-request failures are returned to the Manager, not logged. Set `TMA_DEBUG=true` to log each failed Traefik API call (URL and status) to the journal, then reproduce the error. The startup line also shows the active config, e.g. `traefik=http://localhost:8080, insecure-tls=false, traefik-auth=true, debug=true`.

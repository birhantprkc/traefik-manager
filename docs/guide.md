## Management

These tabs are always visible. They let you read and write your Traefik dynamic config.

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| [Routes](tab-routes.md) | Create, edit, delete, and enable/disable HTTP, TCP, and UDP routes |
| [Middlewares](tab-middlewares.md) | Create and manage middlewares with built-in templates |
| [Services](tab-services.md) | Read-only view of all services across every provider |

**Multiple config files** - mount several Traefik dynamic config files using `CONFIG_DIR` or `CONFIG_PATHS`. A dropdown in the route/middleware forms lets you choose which file each entry is saved to. See [Environment Variables](env-vars.md) for setup.

---

## Stat panel

Above the content on the Dashboard, Routes, Middlewares and Services tabs sits a panel that answers one question: is anything wrong right now.

A verdict line sums up every problem in plain language and names the providers responsible. Four cards - HTTP routers, TCP/UDP routers, services and middlewares - each show a total, a strip with one cell per object sorted worst-first, and counts you can click to jump straight to the broken ones. Below them, entry points are listed with their protocol, flags, address, how many routers are bound to each, and a runtime footer with the Traefik version, uptime and whether metrics, access logs and tracing are on.

Colour is rationed: a healthy install is calm and almost monochrome, so anything coloured is worth reading. A provider strip lets you scope all four cards to one provider in a click.

Choose which of the four tabs show it under **Settings - Interface - Show on**, and switch it to a denser layout with **Compact stat cards**. The same visual language is used by the [Logs](tab-logs.md) and [CrowdSec](tab-crowdsec.md) analytics panels.

---

## Static Config Editor

Edit your Traefik static config (`traefik.yml`) directly from the UI - no SSH or file editor needed. Changes are staged and backed up automatically; a one-click restart applies them via your configured restart method.

**What you can manage:**
- Entrypoints - ports, redirects, trusted IPs, PROXY protocol, TLS defaults, middleware chains, timeouts
- Certificate resolvers - ACME challenges, custom CA, key type, EAB, DNS propagation
- Providers - Docker and File toggles, other providers via templates, throttle duration
- Plugins (remote and local), API and dashboard, logging with rotation and access-log filters
- Observability (ping, Prometheus, OTLP tracing) and system options (servers transport, rule syntax)
- Raw YAML editor (Monaco/VS Code engine) for anything else

Works identically for [remote agents](agent.md#static-config-editing) - the sections read and write the active agent's own `traefik.yml`.

**Setup required** - this feature needs two things configured:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Mount `traefik.yml` read-write | `-v /path/to/traefik.yml:/app/traefik.yml` (no `:ro`) |
| Set `RESTART_METHOD` | How TM restarts Traefik after a config change - `proxy`, `poison-pill`, or `socket` |

See the [Static Config Editor](static.md) page for full setup instructions including how to configure each restart method.

---

## Multi-Server

Manage unlimited remote Traefik instances from one UI through [TMA](agent.md), a small Go agent that runs next to Traefik on each server. A switcher in the nav bar changes the active server, and every tab - routes, middlewares, services, backups, logs - then works against it. No VPN or SSH required.

The setup wizard generates a ready-to-paste Docker Compose or Docker Run command, and the API key is shown once and stored encrypted.

---

## Backups

Every change writes a timestamped backup first, and any of them can be restored in one click. Retention is configurable.

[Git backup](git-backup.md) additionally pushes your config to GitHub, Gitea, Forgejo, GitLab or any HTTPS remote, with commit history, side-by-side diffs and one-click restore of any commit. Agents can push to the Host's repository on their own branch, one branch per server, so a single repository covers every server.

---

## Visualizations

Optional tabs. Dashboard, Route Map and TLS Options toggle on in **Settings - Interface - Tabs**; CrowdSec toggles on in **Settings - System Monitoring - Tab Visibility**. The setup wizard offers Dashboard and Route Map, but not TLS Options or CrowdSec. No extra mounts needed. No extra mounts needed.

| Tab                           | Description                                                                    |
| -------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Dashboard](tab-dashboard.md) | Routes grouped by category with app icons, custom groups, per-card editing, and one-click app launching |
| [Route Map](tab-routemap.md)  | Topology connection map - entry points → routes → middlewares → services       |
| [TLS Options](tab-tls-options.md) | Named `tls.options` profiles - min/max version, ciphers, mTLS - assignable per route |
| [CrowdSec](tab-crowdsec.md)   | Who is attacking, from where, how and what they went after, from a CrowdSec LAPI; ban, captcha, bypass or unban with one click |

---

## Monitoring

Optional tabs - each requires a file mounted into the container.

| Tab | Mount required | Description |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| [Certificates](tab-certs.md) | `acme.json:/app/acme.json:ro` | TLS certificates with expiry tracking. `ACME_JSON_PATH` accepts several files or a directory, for setups with one resolver per storage file |
| [Plugins](tab-plugins.md) | `traefik.yml:/app/traefik.yml:ro` plus `STATIC_CONFIG_PATH=/app/traefik.yml` (no default) | Plugins declared in your static config |
| [Logs](tab-logs.md) | `access.log:/app/logs/access.log:ro` | Access log analytics: status, latency, paths, clients and services as clickable cards over a live tail, with optional auto refresh and a [world map](geoip.md) |

---

## Providers

Read-only tabs that pull live data from the Traefik API. No extra mounts needed - just a working API connection.

### Orchestrators

| Tab | Provider |
|-----|----------|
| [Docker](tab-docker.md) | `docker` |
| [Kubernetes](tab-kubernetes.md) | `kubernetesCRD` / `kubernetesIngress` / `kubernetesGateway` |
| [Swarm](tab-swarm.md) | `swarm` |
| [Nomad](tab-nomad.md) | `nomad` |
| [ECS](tab-ecs.md) | `ecs` |
| [Consul Catalog](tab-consulcatalog.md) | `consulCatalog` |

### Key-Value Stores

| Tab | Provider |
|-----|----------|
| [Redis](tab-redis.md) | `redis` |
| [etcd](tab-etcd.md) | `etcd` |
| [Consul KV](tab-consul.md) | `consul` |
| [ZooKeeper](tab-zookeeper.md) | `zooKeeper` |

### Config-based

| Tab | Provider |
|-----|----------|
| [HTTP Provider](tab-http_provider.md) | `http` |
| [File (external)](tab-file_external.md) | `file` |

> Traefik Manager's own routes are automatically excluded from the File provider tab.

## Configuration

Settings open from the gear in the top bar. Each pane lists its settings as aligned rows carrying the setting name, what it does and its control, in the same visual language as the rest of the app.

The search box above the panes filters by setting name and description, and it searches every pane at once: matches in panes you are not looking at show as a count beside that pane in the sidebar, so you can find a setting without knowing where it lives. Clearing the box restores everything.

A verdict line appears above the search when something needs attention, so a warning like no authentication being active is visible from any pane rather than only from the one that owns it.

| Page                                   | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------| -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [manager.yml](manager-yml.md)          | Full settings file reference - all keys, types, and defaults                                  |
| [Environment Variables](env-vars.md)   | All supported environment variables with override behaviour                                   |
| [OIDC / SSO Login](oidc.md)            | Supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) as an additional login method alongside the built-in password. |
| [Notification Webhooks](webhooks.md)   | Forward events to Discord, Slack, ntfy or any JSON endpoint                                   |
| [Git Repository Backup](git-backup.md) | Auto-push, commit history, diff viewer and one-click restore                                  |

---

## Operations

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Reset Password](reset-password.md) | CLI reset, TOTP recovery, and manual reset via manager.yml |
| [Security](security.md) | Security controls, API keys, sessions, and hardening recommendations |
| [Traefik Hardening](hardening.md) | CVE advisories, header aliases, forwardAuth limits, and real client IPs |
| [Development](development.md) | Project layout, running the test suite, and what a pull request needs |

---

## Self Route

Put Traefik Manager itself behind Traefik so you can access it via a domain with HTTPS.

Go to **Settings - Connection - Self Route**. The URL field pre-fills from your current hostname and the service URL is detected from your existing config if a matching route is found. Click **Save Route** - TM writes the router and service entries into your dynamic config file. No changes to `traefik.yml` needed.

## Mobile App

A companion Android app for managing Traefik Manager on the go. See the [requirements table](mobile.md#requirements) for which server version each app release needs.

Connect it with an API key: go to **Settings - Authentication - API Keys**, click **Add Key**, enter a device name, and copy the generated key. Each device gets its own key, so one can be revoked without affecting the others.

<div class="vp-grid-cards">
<div class="vp-card">

**<img src="/images/icon.png" style="height:24px;width:24px;vertical-align:middle;display:inline-block"> Traefik Manager Mobile**

Browse routes, middlewares, and services. Enable/disable routes. Add and edit with built-in templates. Follows system light/dark theme.

Authenticates via the API key from **Settings → Authentication**.

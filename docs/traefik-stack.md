# Traefik Stack

Install Traefik and Traefik Manager with a single interactive command. It installs `tm`, a CLI that asks what you want to install and how, generates all required config files, starts the services, and manages the install afterwards.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get-traefik.xyzlab.dev | bash
```

`tm` lands in `/usr/local/bin`. Re-running the one-liner updates `tm` and opens `tm install`, which detects an existing install and offers to update or reconfigure it. Installs made by the old `setup.sh` are adopted automatically: run any `tm` command in the install directory (or pass `--dir`) for Docker installs; the Linux service and binary agent are picked up by any `tm` command when no Docker install is found, or by `tm install` with the same mode. Their secrets stay where they are until the first `tm reconfigure`, which moves them to `.env` (or the agent env file for the binary agent).

## Managing the install

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `tm status` | Mode, directory, services, URLs, health |
| `tm update` | Pulls images, `git pull`, or downloads the agent binary, then restarts |
| `tm logs [service]` | Follows the logs (`--no-follow`, `-n <lines>`) |
| `tm restart`, `tm start`, `tm stop` | Whole install, or one service |
| `tm password` | Prints the temporary password from the logs |
| `tm reconfigure [--section <id>]` | Re-runs the wizard pre-filled, regenerates the files it wrote, restarts (`--list` shows the sections) |
| `tm add crowdsec` | Adds CrowdSec to an existing install |
| `tm doctor` | Checks Docker, ports, DNS, `acme.json`, health endpoints, CrowdSec |
| `tm uninstall` | Stops the services and removes the files tm wrote, keeping any you changed. `--purge` also removes configs, data and volumes |
| `tm self-update` | Updates `tm` itself |

Commands find the install from `--dir` or `TM_DIR`, then the current directory, then the installs `tm` already knows about.

| Mode | Secrets | tm's record of the install |
|---|---|---|
| Docker modes | `<install dir>/.env` (mode 600) | `<install dir>/.tm/state.yml` |
| Linux service | - | `/etc/traefik-manager/tm-state.yml` |
| Binary agent | `/etc/traefik-manager-agent/env` | `/etc/traefik-manager-agent/tm-state.yml` |

### Non-interactive install

`tm install --answers answers.yml --yes` runs without prompts. `tm install --dump-answers answers.yml` writes the answers of a wizard run (no secrets) to start from, and `--dry-run` renders every file without starting anything. Secrets come from environment variables of the same name (`TMA_API_KEY`, `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN`, ...) or a `secrets:` map in the file. Schema and examples: [traefik-stack README](https://github.com/chr0nzz/traefik-stack#non-interactive).

## Install modes

The first question is what to install:

```
What would you like to install?
  1) Traefik + Traefik Manager (full stack)
  2) Traefik Manager only
  3) Traefik Manager Agent
```

**Traefik Manager only** then asks how to deploy it:

```
Deployment method
  1) Docker
  2) Linux service (systemd)
```

`tm install --mode <mode>` skips the menus: `full`, `tm-docker`, `tm-native`, `agent-docker`, `agent-docker-traefik`, `agent-binary`, or `agent` to pick only the agent method.

---

## Mode 1 - Traefik + Traefik Manager (full stack)

Installs both via Docker Compose. Best for a fresh server with nothing running yet.

### Prerequisites

- A Linux server (amd64, arm64 or armv7). Docker is installed for you on Debian/Ubuntu, RHEL/Fedora and Arch; anything else falls back to the `get.docker.com` script.
- A domain name with DNS pointing to your server
- Ports 80 and 443 open for internet-facing deployments

### Sections and review screen

The setup runs through numbered sections (General, Deployment type, Domain, TLS / Certificates, Dynamic config, Optional mounts, CrowdSec, Docker network). After the last one a review table summarizes every answer:

```
  Review configuration
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1  General             ~/traefik-stack
   2  Deployment type     external (internet-facing)
   3  Domain              example.com  dash:traefik.example.com  tm:manager.example.com
   4  TLS / Certificates  Let's Encrypt DNS (cloudflare)  you@example.com
   5  Dynamic config      Directory
   6  Optional mounts     logs certs static(restart:proxy)
   7  CrowdSec            install alongside
   8  Docker network      traefik-net  api:8080
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Edit a section (1-8) or Enter to install:
```

Type a section number to re-configure it, then press Enter with no number to install. Nothing is written to disk until you confirm.

### What the wizard configures

**Install directory** - where all files are created (default: `~/traefik-stack`)

**Deployment type**

- **External** - internet-facing, requires ports 80/443 open and DNS A records
- **Internal** - LAN, VPN, or Tailscale only

**Domain**

Your base domain and subdomains for:
- Traefik dashboard (default: `traefik.yourdomain.com`)
- Traefik Manager (default: `manager.yourdomain.com`)
- Whether to enable the Traefik API dashboard UI

**TLS / Certificates**

| Option                            | Requires                                                |
| -----------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------------------|
| Let's Encrypt - HTTP challenge    | Port 80 open. Simplest for most setups.                 |
| Let's Encrypt - DNS: Cloudflare   | A Cloudflare API token. Works without port 80.          |
| Let's Encrypt - DNS: Route 53     | AWS access key, secret, and region.                     |
| Let's Encrypt - DNS: DigitalOcean | A DigitalOcean API token.                               |
| Let's Encrypt - DNS: Namecheap    | Namecheap API user and key.                             |
| Let's Encrypt - DNS: DuckDNS      | A DuckDNS token.                                        |
| Let's Encrypt - DNS: deSEC        | A deSEC token. Works without port 80.                   |
| No TLS (HTTP only)                | Port 80 only. Suitable for internal LAN use.            |

**Dynamic config layout**

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| Single file (`dynamic.yml`) | All routes in one file. Simpler to start with. |
| Directory (one `.yml` per service) | One file per service. Easier to manage at scale. |

**Optional mounts**

| Mount | Default | Enables |
|---|---|---|
| Access logs | Yes | Logs tab in Traefik Manager |
| SSL certs (`acme.json`) | Yes | Certs tab in Traefik Manager |
| Traefik static config (`traefik.yml`) | No | Plugins tab + Static Config editor |

**Docker network** - network name (default: `traefik-net`) and Traefik internal API port (default: `8080`)

**Static config editor** - enabling the static config mount also asks which restart method to use (socket proxy, poison pill, or direct socket). `tm` then writes every required compose addition - socket proxy service, shared signal volume, Traefik healthcheck, env vars on TM - so the editor works out of the box. It covers entrypoints, certificate resolvers, providers, plugins, API, logging, observability and system settings, plus a raw YAML editor for anything else. See [Static Config Editor](static.md).

For an existing install that skipped it:

- **`tm reconfigure --section mounts`** - answer the static config questions differently. `docker-compose.yml` is regenerated from your answers; config files and backups are preserved. If you edited the compose file by hand, `tm` asks before overwriting it and keeps a backup.
- **Enable manually** - see [Enable static config editor](static-enable.md) to add only the volume, env vars, and restart method to your existing compose.

**CrowdSec IDS**

| Option | What happens |
|---|---|
| Install as part of this stack | Adds a `crowdsec` service, generates a random bouncer API key, writes `crowdsec/acquis.yaml` pointing at the Traefik access log, and sets `CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL` + `CROWDSEC_API_KEY` on Traefik Manager. |
| Connect to existing instance | Prompts for the LAPI URL and bouncer key of a CrowdSec instance you already run, plus optional machine credentials for alerts and unban. No new service is added. |

Choosing the install option turns the access log mount on automatically - CrowdSec needs it.

Once installed, enable the **CrowdSec** tab under **Settings → System Monitoring → Tab Visibility** to view active decisions, recent alerts, and unban IPs.

### Directory structure

```
~/traefik-stack/
- docker-compose.yml
- .env                   (secrets, mode 600)
- .tm/
  - state.yml            (tm's record of the install)
- traefik/
  - traefik.yml
  - acme.json
  - logs/
    - access.log
  - config/
    - dynamic.yml        (single file layout)
    - *.yml              (directory layout)
- traefik-manager/
  - config/
  - backups/
- crowdsec/              (only if CrowdSec install mode chosen)
  - acquis.yaml
```

### DNS records

Create A records before running `tm install` so Let's Encrypt can issue certificates:

```
traefik.yourdomain.com  A  <server-ip>
manager.yourdomain.com  A  <server-ip>
```

### Updating

| Option | Command |
|---|---|
| `tm` | `tm update` |
| Manual | `cd ~/traefik-stack && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` |

### Useful commands

```bash
tm status
tm logs traefik-manager
tm doctor
tm password
tm restart
tm stop
```

Or directly with Compose from `~/traefik-stack`: `docker compose logs -f traefik-manager`, `docker compose down`, `docker compose restart`.

---

## Mode 2 - Traefik Manager only (Docker)

Installs just Traefik Manager as a Docker container. Use this when Traefik is already running on your server.

### Sections and review screen

Numbered sections (General, Network, Access, Dynamic config, Optional mounts) end with the same review table as the other modes:

```
  Edit a section (1-5) or Enter to install:
```

### What the wizard configures

**Install directory** - default: `~/traefik-manager`

**Network** - connect to an existing Traefik Docker network (default: `traefik-net`) or create a new one (default: `traefik-manager-net`)

**Access**

- **Via Traefik labels** - expose Traefik Manager through your existing Traefik instance with a domain and TLS certificate (same TLS options as full stack mode)
- **Direct port** - expose a host port (default: 5000), no Traefik labels needed

**Dynamic config layout** - single file or directory, same options as the full stack mode

**Optional mounts** - you provide the host paths to your existing Traefik files:

| Mount | Default | Path asked |
|---|---|---|
| Access logs | Yes | Path to Traefik access log (default: `/var/log/traefik/access.log`) |
| SSL certs (`acme.json`) | Yes | Path to `acme.json` (default: `/etc/traefik/acme.json`) |
| Traefik static config | No | Path to `traefik.yml` (default: `/etc/traefik/traefik.yml`) |

**Static config editor** - mounting the static config also asks for the restart method (socket proxy, poison pill, or direct socket) and the Traefik container name (default: `traefik`).

To add static config support later, either run `tm reconfigure --section mounts` (regenerates the compose file, preserving config and backups) or follow [Enable static config editor](static-enable.md).

This mode does not ask about CrowdSec. Connect it after install under **Settings → System Monitoring → CrowdSec**, or set `CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL` and `CROWDSEC_API_KEY` in the compose file yourself.

### Directory structure

```
~/traefik-manager/
- docker-compose.yml
- .env                   (secrets, mode 600, only when there are any)
- .tm/
  - state.yml            (tm's record of the install)
- config/
  - dynamic.yml          (or config directory)
- backups/
```

### Updating

| Option | Command |
|---|---|
| `tm` | `tm update` |
| Manual | `cd ~/traefik-manager && docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` |

### Useful commands

```bash
tm status
tm logs
tm doctor
tm password
```

---

## Mode 3 - Traefik Manager only (Linux service)

Installs Traefik Manager as a native systemd service. No Docker required. Use this when you run Traefik natively or prefer not to use containers.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or newer
- `git`, `curl`
- `systemd`

### Sections and review screen

Numbered sections (General, Service user, Dynamic config, Optional mounts) end with the same review table as the other modes:

```
  Edit a section (1-4) or Enter to install:
```

### What the wizard configures

- **Install directory** - where the app is cloned (default: `/opt/traefik-manager`)
- **Data directory** - config and backups (default: `/var/lib/traefik-manager`)
- **Port** - default: 5000
- **Dedicated system user** - creates a `traefik-manager` system user to run the service (recommended)
- **Dynamic config layout** - single file (default: `/etc/traefik/dynamic.yml`) or directory (default: `/etc/traefik/conf.d`)

**Optional mounts** - asks for host paths to each:

| Mount | Default | Path asked |
|---|---|---|
| SSL certs (`acme.json`) | Yes | Path to `acme.json` (default: `/etc/traefik/acme.json`) |
| Access logs | Yes | Path to Traefik access log (default: `/var/log/traefik/access.log`) |
| Traefik static config | No | Path to `traefik.yml` (default: `/etc/traefik/traefik.yml`) |

**Static config editor** - mounting the static config asks how Traefik itself runs on this server:

| Traefik runs as | Restart method |
|---|---|
| Docker | Poison pill (recommended - signal file, no Docker socket) or direct Docker socket, which puts the `traefik-manager` user in the `docker` group. Direct socket also asks for the container name (default: `traefik`). |
| Linux service (systemd) | Poison pill only. `tm` installs a `traefik-restart.path` unit that restarts your Traefik service (default name: `traefik`) when the signal file appears. |

Poison pill asks for the signal file path (default: `/var/lib/traefik-manager/signals/restart.sig`).

To add static config support later, either run `tm reconfigure --section mounts` (regenerates the systemd unit and restarts the service) or follow [Enable static config editor](static-enable.md) to add the env vars by hand.

This mode does not ask about CrowdSec. Connect it after install under **Settings → System Monitoring → CrowdSec**, or add `CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL` and `CROWDSEC_API_KEY` to the unit file (`sudo systemctl edit traefik-manager`).

`tm` clones the repository, creates a Python venv, installs dependencies, builds the vendor assets and CSS, writes the systemd unit, and enables the service. Its record of the install is `/etc/traefik-manager/tm-state.yml`.

### Useful commands

```bash
tm status
tm logs
tm doctor
tm password
tm restart
```

Or with systemd directly: `sudo systemctl status traefik-manager`, `sudo journalctl -u traefik-manager -f`, `sudo systemctl restart traefik-manager`.

### Updating

| Option | Command |
|---|---|
| `tm` | `tm update` |
| Manual | run as the owner of the install directory (`traefik-manager` when a service user was created): `git pull`, `venv/bin/pip install -q -r requirements.txt gunicorn`, `scripts/setup-assets.sh`, then `sudo systemctl restart traefik-manager` |

---

## Mode 4 - Traefik Manager Agent

Installs the [TMA agent](agent.md) on a remote server so a central Traefik Manager can manage it. This mode does not install TM itself.

### Install methods

After choosing **Traefik Manager Agent**, `tm` shows an arrow-key menu:

```
Install method
▸ Docker - Agent only (alongside existing Traefik)
  Docker - Agent + Traefik (deploy both together)
  Binary - Agent only (systemd service, no Docker)
```

Use `↑`/`↓` to move, `Enter` to select, or type a number.

To skip the menus, pass the mode and the agent settings as flags:

```bash
tm install --mode agent-docker --api-key <key> --traefik-url http://traefik:8080
```

### Sections and review screen

```
  Review configuration
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   1  Install method     Agent only
   2  API key            sk-••••••••
   3  Traefik connection http://traefik:8080
   4  Optional paths     logs
   5  Restart method     none
   6  CrowdSec           disabled
   7  Git backup         disabled
   8  Install location   /opt/traefik-manager-agent  :8090
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Edit a section (1-8) or Enter to install:
```

Type a section number to re-configure it, then press Enter to return to the review. Press Enter with no number to install. The binary method has no **Install location** section, so it shows 7.

### What the wizard asks

**Traefik connection (section 3)**
- Traefik API URL (default: `http://traefik:8080`)
- Dynamic config path (default: `/app/config`)
- Skip TLS verification - shown only when the URL starts with `https://`; sets `TRAEFIK_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` for self-signed or Cloudflare Origin certs
- Traefik API basic auth - username and password, if the API is behind it
- Mount static config (`traefik.yml`) - toggle; if enabled, asks for the path

**Traefik install (Docker - Agent + Traefik only)** replaces section 3
- Enable HTTPS on port 443
- TLS certificate method: Let's Encrypt HTTP challenge, Let's Encrypt Cloudflare DNS, or no TLS
- ACME email (if Let's Encrypt)
- Cloudflare DNS API token (if Cloudflare DNS)
- Cert resolver name (default: `letsencrypt`)
- Enable Traefik dashboard and hostname
- Docker network name (default: `traefik-net`)

**Optional paths (section 4)** - all off by default
- Mount ACME / certs (default: `/etc/traefik/acme.json`)
- Mount access logs (default: `/var/log/traefik/access.log`)
- Mount plugins directory (default: `/etc/traefik/plugins`)

**Restart method (section 5)**
- None, socket proxy, poison pill, or direct Docker socket

**CrowdSec (section 6)**

| Option | What it does |
|---|---|
| None | Skip CrowdSec |
| Install alongside agent | Adds a `crowdsec` service, generates a random bouncer key, writes `crowdsec/acquis.yaml`. Requires the access log mount (prompts if not set). Docker installs only. |
| Connect to existing | Enter LAPI URL and API key. |

**Git backup (section 7)** - repo URL, branch, username, token, auto-push toggle

**Install location (section 8, Docker only)** - install directory and agent port (default: `8090`)

### Docker - Agent only output

Generates `docker-compose.yml` with only the env vars and volumes for the options you enabled, puts the API key and other secrets in `.env`, then runs `docker compose up -d`. If CrowdSec install was chosen, adds a `crowdsec` service and writes `crowdsec/acquis.yaml`.

### Docker - Agent + Traefik output

Creates this structure and starts both containers:

```
/opt/traefik-manager-agent/
  docker-compose.yml           (traefik + traefik-manager-agent services)
  .env                         (secrets, mode 600)
  .tm/state.yml                (tm's record of the install)
  backups/
  traefik/
    traefik.yml                (static config - entrypoints, file provider, cert resolver)
    acme.json                  (created empty, chmod 600 - if TLS enabled)
    config/                    (dynamic config dir, shared between Traefik and agent)
    logs/
      access.log
  crowdsec/                    (only if CrowdSec install chosen)
    acquis.yaml
```

Traefik's API port (8080) is not published - the agent reaches it over the internal Docker network (`http://traefik:8080`).

### Binary output

Downloads the `tma` binary from GitHub Releases to `/usr/local/bin/tma`, writes a systemd unit with the non-secret `Environment=` lines and `EnvironmentFile=/etc/traefik-manager-agent/env` for the secrets, then runs `systemctl enable --now tma`.

### Useful commands

Both install methods:

```bash
tm status
tm logs
tm doctor
tm update
tm reconfigure --section apikey
```

**Docker:**
```bash
cd /opt/traefik-manager-agent
docker compose logs -f
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

**Binary:**
```bash
sudo systemctl status tma
sudo journalctl -u tma -f
sudo systemctl restart tma
```

### Next steps after install

1. In TM **Settings → Agents**, click **Add Agent**
2. Enter a name and the agent URL (e.g. `http://server-ip:8090`). Traefik Manager generates the API key and shows it once - copy it and set it as `TMA_API_KEY` on the agent (`tm reconfigure --section apikey`, or edit the agent's env if you already installed it with a different key).
3. Use the **server switcher** in the TM nav bar to switch to this agent

---

## First login

Once `tm install` completes it prints a temporary password:

```
Temporary password  abc123xyz
```

If it is not shown, run `tm password`, or read it from the logs:

:::tabs
== Docker
```bash
docker logs traefik-manager | grep -A3 "AUTO-GENERATED"
```
== Linux service
```bash
sudo journalctl -u traefik-manager | grep -A3 "AUTO-GENERATED"
```
:::

Log in with the temporary password. You are taken straight to the setup wizard, and a forced password-change screen appears as soon as you finish it.

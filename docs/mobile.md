## Setup

### 1. Generate an API key

In the Traefik Manager web UI go to **Settings → Authentication → App / Mobile API Keys** and click **Add Key**. Enter a device name (e.g. `My Phone`) and click **Generate**. Copy the full key - it is only shown once.

::: tip One key per device
Each device should have its own key. You can have up to 10 keys at once. Keys are identified by their device name in the settings list, so you can revoke a single device without affecting others.
:::

### 2. Configure the app

Open the mobile app and enter:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Server URL | Base URL of your Traefik Manager instance, e.g. `https://traefik-manager.example.com` |
| API Key | The key generated in step 1 |

Tap **Connect** - the app connects immediately.

::: tip API key is optional when built-in auth is disabled
If you have disabled Traefik Manager's built-in authentication (e.g. you are using an external provider like Authentik), leave the API key field empty. The app will detect that auth is disabled and connect without a key.

If built-in auth is enabled, an API key is required.
:::

::: info Using OIDC to log in to the web UI?
OIDC login applies to the web browser only. The mobile app always authenticates via API key. If you log in to the web UI via OIDC, generate an API key under **Settings → Authentication → App / Mobile API Keys**, then enter it in the mobile app - the process is the same as for password-based users.
:::

::: info Internal CAs and plain HTTP
Since v1.7.1 the Android app trusts CA certificates installed on the device, so instances secured by an internal/private CA work: install your root CA on the phone under **Settings → Security → Encryption & credentials → Install a certificate → CA certificate**, then connect with your `https://` URL. Plain `http://` URLs (LAN-only setups) are also supported.

## Navigation

The app uses a bottom navigation bar with four tabs: **Home**, **Routes**, **Middleware**, and **Services**. An optional **Logs** tab appears when enabled.

### Settings drawer

Tap the **hamburger icon** (top-left of any screen) to open the navigation drawer. The drawer provides access to all settings pages:

| Section | Items |
|---|---|
| General | Appearance, App Lock, Traefik, Server, Active Server, Client IP |
| Tabs | Logs, Certificates, Plugins, CrowdSec |
| Data | Backups |
| Info | About |

## Features

### Dashboard (Home)

- Summary stat cards for HTTP Routers, TCP Routers, UDP Routers, Services, and Middlewares - each shows a ring chart with success / warning / error counts
- Tap **Explore →** on any card to jump to the matching tab filtered to that protocol
- Entrypoints listed at the bottom with name, address, and protocol badges
- On tablets and larger screens, stat cards display in a 2-column grid

### Routes

- List all HTTP, TCP, and UDP routes with status, domain, target, and attached middlewares
- Filter by protocol using the segmented button bar
- Enable / disable routes with a toggle - configuration is preserved, Traefik stops routing until re-enabled
- Add new routes via a form (name, subdomain, one or more domain chips, target IP, port, protocol, cert resolver)
- Select multiple domains when creating or editing an HTTP route - generates a multi-host rule (`Host(\`sub.d1\`) || Host(\`sub.d2\`)`)
- Entry points fetched from the Traefik API and shown as selectable chips for HTTP, TCP, and UDP; `websecure` is pre-selected for HTTP; UDP is single-select
- Middlewares fetched from the Traefik API and shown as selectable chips
- Toggle **Skip TLS Verification** per route for backends with self-signed certificates (`insecureSkipVerify`)
- **Wildcard Certificate Domains** - when TLS is enabled, toggle on to specify a main domain and SANs (e.g. `*.example.com`) for wildcard certificate requests via DNS challenge
- **TLS Options profile** - select any named TLS options profile configured on your Traefik instance to apply it to the route
- Add and remove **backends** on a route, for both new and existing routes, so traffic is load balanced across several servers. HTTP backends take a per-backend `http`/`https` scheme
- Sticky sessions, health checks and router priority are read back with the route and preserved when you save. They are configured on the web app; the phone shows them as chips on the route card
- A route with more than one backend shows a `+N` badge on its card
- Edit existing routes
- Delete routes with confirmation
- Tap a domain to open it in the browser

### Middlewares

- List all middlewares with type, protocol, and YAML config preview
- Filter by protocol
- Add new middlewares - two-step flow: choose from 23 built-in templates then fill in the wizard form

    | Template | Description |
    |---|---|
    | Blank | Start from scratch |
    | HTTPS Redirect | Redirect HTTP to HTTPS |
    | Basic Auth | Password protect your service |
    | Digest Auth | MD5 digest authentication |
    | Security Headers | HSTS, X-Frame, XSS filter |
    | Rate Limit | Limit requests per source IP |
    | Forward Auth | Delegate auth to an external service |
    | Authentik | Authentik SSO forward auth |
    | Authelia | Authelia forward auth |
    | Gatekeeper | Gatekeeper forward auth (with forward Authorization header option) |
    | OIDC Auth | OpenID Connect auth via traefik-oidc-auth plugin |
    | IP Allowlist | Restrict access by IP range |
    | Private IPs | Allow LAN / private IP ranges only |
    | CORS | Cross-origin resource sharing headers |
    | Redirect Regex | Redirect using a regex pattern |
    | Strip Prefix | Remove a URL path prefix |
    | Add Prefix | Prepend a URL path prefix |
    | Replace Path | Replace request URL path |
    | Compress | Enable gzip / brotli compression |
    | Retry | Retry failed requests |
    | Circuit Breaker | Stop traffic when error rate is high |
    | Buffering | Buffer request and response bodies |
    | In-Flight Req | Limit concurrent requests |
    | Chain | Combine multiple middlewares |

- Edit existing middlewares (name + YAML)
- Delete middlewares with confirmation

### Services

- Live service list with protocol badge, type badge, and status chip (Success / Warning / Error)
- Server health fraction (e.g. `2/3 active`)
- Provider and linked router chips
- Tap the info icon for a full detail sheet

### Logs

The Logs tab is hidden by default. To enable it, open the drawer and go to **Logs**, then toggle **Show Logs Tab**.

::: warning Requires server-side configuration
The Logs tab requires `ACCESS_LOG_PATH` to be set in your Traefik Manager server configuration pointing to a Traefik access log file.
:::

- Each entry parsed into a card showing method, status code + description (e.g. `404 Not Found`), path, IP, service name, and duration
- Tap any card to open a full detail screen with all fields and the raw log line
- Adjustable line count: 100, 150, or 200 lines
- Pull to refresh
- Country flags per request when GeoIP is enabled on the server, with a ranked country strip above the list; tap a country to filter to it
- Both the CLF and `json` Traefik access-log formats are parsed

### CrowdSec

The CrowdSec tab is hidden by default. To enable it, open the drawer and go to **CrowdSec**, then toggle **Show CrowdSec Tab**. It needs CrowdSec credentials configured in the web app under **Settings -> Security**.

- Active decisions listed with the banned address, scenario, type (ban, captcha, bypass), expiry and origin
- Counts for bans, captchas and bypasses, and filtering by decision type
- Search by address or scenario
- Delete a decision to unban an address
- Country flags on each decision when GeoIP is enabled, with a ranked country strip; tap a country to filter to it
- Pull to refresh

### Backups

Access via the drawer under **Data → Backups**. Create and restore local `.bak` configuration backups (route config and static config sections).

**Git Backup** - tap the Git Backup row at the top of the Backups screen to view the git backup status, branch, last push time, and full commit history. Tap **Push Now** to trigger an immediate git push, or tap any commit row to restore the config to that point in time (requires git backup configured in Settings on the web app).

### Multi-Server Agent Mode

When TMA agents are registered in the web app, the **Active Server** row appears in **Settings - General**. Tap it to switch between:

- **Host** - manages the Traefik instance connected to your Traefik Manager server
- **Remote agents** - any TMA agent registered in the web app, shown with a live health indicator

When an agent is active, the agent name appears as a subtitle below each tab title, and all data (routes, middlewares, services, backups) reflects that agent's Traefik instance. Switching servers clears the query cache so tabs reload immediately.

To rename an agent, tap the pencil icon on its row - the name becomes an editable field. Tap the checkmark or submit to save.

### Widgets

Home screen widgets show the same cards the app does, built from the same data. Add one from your launcher's widget picker; the setup screen opens as soon as you place it.

Pick up to four cards per widget:

| Card | Shows |
|---|---|
| All servers | Every server with routers, services, warnings and bans, plus a combined services strip |
| HTTP routers | How many are live, with the provider breakdown |
| TCP / UDP routers | Stream routers and how they split |
| Services | Backends up against backends configured |
| Middlewares | In use against defined but unused |
| Attacking sources | Who is probing, who is banned, and the repeat/one-shot split |
| Scenarios | Which buckets are firing, ranked |
| Targeted paths | What they are reaching for, ranked |
| Bans in force | Decisions holding now, by origin |

Three sizes are offered in the picker, and each renders as many of your chosen cards as it has room for:

| Size | Cards |
|---|---|
| 2x2 | One |
| 4x2 | Two side by side |
| 4x4 | Four in a grid |

Each widget also picks its own server and its own refresh interval - 15, 30 or 60 minutes, defaulting to 30. One background job serves every widget, running at the shortest interval any of them asked for, so a single fast widget does not drag the rest onto its cadence. The refresh control on the widget updates that widget immediately.

Cards carry the desk's own detail: the signal strip aggregates when there are more objects than squares and prints what one square stands for, trouble tints the whole card border amber or red, and an unreachable server is reported as such rather than as a zero. A failed refresh keeps the last known numbers and marks them `stale`. Tapping a card opens the app on the page that card belongs to, on the server it was watching.

### Edit Mode

Tap the **pencil icon** in the top bar to enter edit mode. In edit mode, cards reveal:

- **Toggle** (routes only) - enable or disable the route
- **Edit** - open the edit form
- **Delete** - remove with confirmation

Buttons are hidden when not in edit mode to keep the list clean.

---

## Settings

All settings are accessed from the navigation drawer (hamburger icon in the top bar).

### Appearance

Switch between Light, Dark, and System theme. On Android 12+, **Dynamic Color** adapts the app's UI chrome (backgrounds, cards, borders) to your wallpaper palette while keeping status colors (green/yellow/red) semantically distinct.

### Client IP

A read-only diagnostic showing what the server sees for your request: the trusted client IP that feeds the login rate limiter, audit log, `ipAllowList` and CrowdSec, the raw socket peer before any header is trusted, the trusted proxy hop count (`PROXY_FIX_HOPS`), the `X-Forwarded-For` chain and the forwarding headers as received. Each address is tagged public, private, CGNAT, loopback or link-local, and the screen warns when the trusted IP is not public while forwarding headers are present - the signature of a wrong `trustedIPs` or hop count. Needs server v1.8.0 or newer.

### App Lock

Require biometric or device PIN authentication when the app opens or returns from background.

### Traefik

Configure domains, cert resolvers, and the direct Traefik API URL. Includes a **Test Connection** button to verify connectivity to the Traefik API.

### Server

Change the Traefik Manager server URL and API key, or switch to Demo Mode.

### Active Server

Switch between the local Traefik Manager and any registered remote TMA agents. See [Multi-Server Agent Mode](#multi-server-agent-mode) above.

## Connecting without an API key

If Traefik Manager's built-in auth is disabled, leave the **API Key** field empty and tap **Connect**. The app will verify the server is reachable and connect without credentials.

::: danger No auth means no protection
If you disable built-in auth and expose Traefik Manager without any other protection, **anyone who can reach your instance can use the mobile app with no credentials**. Only disable built-in auth if you have an external auth provider (Authentik, Authelia, etc.) in front - and if so, read the [external auth providers](#external-auth-providers) section to ensure the mobile app still works correctly.
:::

---

## External auth providers

If you use an external auth provider (Authentik, Authelia, Keycloak, etc.) via Traefik's `forwardAuth` middleware, the middleware intercepts **all** requests - including the mobile app's API calls - and redirects unauthenticated requests to the provider's login page. The mobile app cannot complete that OAuth/OIDC flow.

The solution is to split the Traefik route into two: one with `forwardAuth` for the web UI, and one without for `/api/*` that relies on Traefik Manager's own API key auth.

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    traefik-manager-web:
      rule: Host(`manager.example.com`) && !PathPrefix(`/api`)
      middlewares: [authentik]
      entryPoints: [websecure]
      service: traefik-manager
      tls:
        certResolver: cloudflare

    traefik-manager-api:
      rule: Host(`manager.example.com`) && PathPrefix(`/api`)
      entryPoints: [websecure]
      service: traefik-manager
      tls:
        certResolver: cloudflare

  services:
    traefik-manager:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://traefik-manager:5000
```

::: warning Keep built-in auth enabled
When using this split-route pattern, keep Traefik Manager's built-in auth **enabled** and generate API keys for your mobile devices. Without built-in auth, the `/api/*` route has no protection.

## Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| Traefik Manager (server) | **v1.10.1 or higher** for mobile v2.x. For mobile v1.x: v1.8.0+ for v1.6.0, v1.5.0+ for v1.5.0, v0.12.0+ for v0.11.0+ |
| Android | 13+ (API 33) for v2.x; 7.0+ (API 24+) for v1.x |

---

## Tech Stack

Version 2.x is native Android: Kotlin 2.4, Jetpack Compose with Material 3 Expressive, Hilt, Retrofit 3 with kotlinx.serialization, DataStore for storage, and Glance with WorkManager for the widgets. Release builds are minified and resource-shrunk with R8.

Version 1.x was built with Expo SDK 54 / React Native 0.81, and is still available on the `v1` branch.

::: tip Upgrading from 1.x
The rewrite ships under the same application id and is signed with the same certificate, so it installs straight over 1.x from either channel and keeps your server, API key and placed widgets. iOS is not supported in 2.x.

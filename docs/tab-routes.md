# Routes Tab

The **Routes** tab (also called Services) is the main management interface. It displays all routes defined in `dynamic.yml` and lets you create, edit, and delete them.

## What it shows

- Route name, rule, target host:port, protocol
- TLS / cert resolver status
- Entry points and attached middlewares
- Status badge from the Traefik API (enabled / warning / error)
- Multi-domain routes show each domain as a separate pill badge; clicking a domain or target copies it to the clipboard
- Full detail view via the info button - shows live Traefik status, service health, and raw config

## Empty state

When no routes exist yet - such as on a fresh install - the tab shows a prompt with an **Add Route** button instead of a blank grid. When a search or filter matches nothing, it shows a "No routes match your filters" message instead.

## Filtering

The filter bar above the grid lets you narrow routes by:

- **Search** - matches against route name
- **Domain** - dropdown of all unique domains extracted from route rules
- **Status** - All / Active / Inactive. Inactive routes are disabled (greyed out) and can be shown or hidden independently of other filters
- **Protocol** - All / HTTP / TCP / UDP

## Views

Toggle between **grid** (default) and **list** view using the button in the filter bar. List view shows a compact table with Status, Protocol, Name, Service, Domain / Rule, Target, Entry Points, Middlewares, and action buttons.

In the [Modern layout](guide.md), grid view uses the redesigned card. The name sits on the top line with small glyphs for anything worth flagging - a padlock for TLS, an open amber padlock without it, a cube for provider-managed routes, a pause for disabled ones, and a warning shield for `insecureSkipVerify`. Below it are the route's hosts and its backend target, each with a copy button; a route matching several hosts shows the first two and a `+N` you can hover for the rest, and a load-balanced route marks its target with the extra backend count. Entry points, middlewares, and the service name run along the footer. **More**, **Edit**, and an enable/disable toggle appear as a rail in the top right on hover, and clicking anywhere else on the card opens the detail panel.

The config file name appears as a chip in the footer only when your routes are genuinely spread across more than one file - single-file users never see it.

## App icons

Enable **Settings - Interface - Routes - Show app icons** to display an app icon next to each route name, in both grid and list view. The toggle is **off by default**. It is stored server-side in `manager.yml` under `ui_prefs`, so it applies to every browser and session (and to both the Host and remote agents).

Icons use the same source and per-route overrides as the [Dashboard](tab-dashboard.md#icon): the slug is auto-detected from the route or service name via the selfh.st CDN. Any custom icon you set on a Dashboard card (a selfh.st slug or a Custom URL, for apps the name match does not recognize) is read from the dashboard config and shown on the Routes tab too. If an icon cannot be resolved it is hidden - no broken-image placeholder.

| Rule Mode                    | **Simple** (default) - use the Subdomain + Domain chip builder to generate a `Host()` rule. **Advanced rule** - type any valid Traefik rule directly (`PathPrefix`, `HostRegexp`, compound rules with `&&` / `\                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | \   | `, etc.). Switch modes with the Simple / Advanced rule toggle at the top of the HTTP section. When editing a route with a complex rule, the form automatically opens in Advanced mode.                                                           |
| Subdomain + Domain(s)        | *(Simple mode only)* Subdomain field plus one or more domain chips. The chip list combines the Domains from Settings - Connection with domains **auto-detected from your existing routes**, and a **+** chip lets you type any other domain on the spot - no Settings trip required. With multiple domains selected, generates a multi-host rule: `Host(\`sub.d1.com\`) \                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | \   | Host(\`sub.d2.com\`)`. Entering a full hostname (with dots) in the Subdomain field uses it as-is. The domain list is a form convenience only - it never affects your Traefik configuration. Long domain names are truncated in the chip display. |
| Backend                      | **Manual** (default) - enter a Target IP / Port for a service this route owns. **Existing service** - reference a service already defined in your config instead; see [Shared services](#shared-services)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Backend Scheme               | `HTTP` or `HTTPS` - the scheme Traefik uses to connect to your backend. Use `HTTPS` when the backend serves TLS internally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Cert Resolver                | Shown for HTTP and TCP routes. Three options: **No TLS** (default) - omits the `tls` key entirely; **named resolver** - uses ACME to issue a certificate; **None (external / custom cert)** - writes `tls: {}` without a resolver, for certificates managed via `tls.yml` or another external source. Named resolvers are detected automatically from your static config's `certificatesResolvers` (and from the Cert Resolver field in Settings), so a custom resolver shows up in the dropdown without re-typing it. When a remote agent is active, the agent's static config is read for its resolvers. |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

The `.yml` extension is added automatically if omitted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

For TCP routes, the Subdomain field builds a `HostSNI` rule. A bare label like `db` becomes ``HostSNI(`db.example.com`)`` using the selected domain, while a value that already contains a dot, like `db.other.tld`, is used as the complete hostname - the same way HTTP routes behave. You can also enter a raw SNI rule directly (``HostSNI(`*`)`` for passthrough). UDP routes route by entry point only - no rule needed.

## Editing a route

Click the pencil icon on any route card, or open the detail panel and click **Edit**.

Saving only rewrites the parts of the route the form owns: the rule, entry points, service reference, middlewares and TLS on the router, and the backends, `passHostHeader` and the insecure-TLS transport on the service. When the form manages them, backends, sticky sessions, health checks and router `priority` are written too - see [Multiple backends and load balancing](#multiple-backends-and-load-balancing). Anything else you have written by hand is preserved, including your own `serversTransport`. An existing route also keeps the service name it already points at, rather than being renamed to `<name>-service`.

::: warning Advanced service types
If a router points at a `weighted`, `mirroring` or `failover` service instead of a `loadBalancer`, that service is left untouched, so editing the target field in the route form has no effect on it. Edit those services directly in the config file.
:::

## Security headers preset

The **Security headers preset** toggle in the HTTP route form generates a middleware that sets a `Permissions-Policy` and the common security headers, so you don't have to hand-write one. It works on the Host and on remote agents alike - on an agent the middleware is written to that agent's config. When enabled on save it:

- creates a middleware named `<route>-headers` under `http.middlewares` and attaches it to the router, and
- records ownership in `manager.yml` under [`managed_middlewares`](./manager-yml#managed-middlewares) so the tool knows it created it.

The generated middleware is a **normal, visible, editable file middleware** - it appears in the [Middlewares tab](./tab-middlewares) like any other and you can hand-tune it there.

**Toggles:**

- **Permissions-Policy** - each browser feature (`geolocation`, `camera`, `microphone`, `fullscreen`, `autoplay`, `payment`, `usb`, `display-capture`, `accelerometer`, `gyroscope`, `magnetometer`) can be set to **self** (only your site), **all** (any site), or **block**. The default allows `self` for the first five and blocks the rest, written via `customResponseHeaders` so it stays version-independent.
- **HSTS** - `stsSeconds: 31536000` + `stsIncludeSubdomains` (force HTTPS for a year).
- **Content-Type nosniff**, **Frame deny** (anti-clickjacking), and a **Referrer-Policy** selector.

**Round-trip and safety:**

- Re-opening the route reads the middleware back into the toggles. If you have hand-edited `<route>-headers` beyond what the toggles can represent, the form shows it as **custom** and leaves your content untouched - change any toggle to regenerate it, or turn the preset off to remove it.
- Turning the preset off removes the `<route>-headers` middleware, detaches it from the router, and clears the ledger entry - but only if the tool created it.
- If a middleware named `<route>-headers` already exists and was **not** created by the preset, the save is refused with a clear message so a hand-authored middleware is never overwritten. Rename or remove it first.
- Renaming a route moves its `<route>-headers` middleware to match the new name.

The preset is available for local (file-provider) HTTP routes; routes on a remote agent are unaffected.

## Streaming preset

The **Optimize for streaming** toggle tunes an HTTP route for media servers (Jellyfin, Emby, Plex), where long transcodes otherwise time out and seeking breaks. Available on the Host and on remote agents. On save it:

- sets `forwardingTimeouts` on the service's `<service>-transport` serversTransport (`responseHeaderTimeout: 0s` - unlimited, so long transcodes aren't cut off - plus a `dialTimeout` and `idleConnTimeout`), and
- forces `passHostHeader` on.

```yaml
serversTransports:
  jellyfin-transport:
    forwardingTimeouts:
      dialTimeout: "30s"
      responseHeaderTimeout: "0s"
      idleConnTimeout: "90s"
```

It shares the same `<service>-transport` as [Skip TLS Verification](#creating-a-route), so the two compose: turning one off leaves the other's key in place, and the transport is removed only when both are off. Turning streaming off removes just the `forwardingTimeouts` key.

Streaming works best **without response buffering** - if a `buffering` or `compress` middleware is attached to the route, the form warns you to remove it. Entry-point `respondingTimeouts` are global and static, so they are not changed here; adjust them in the [Static Config editor](./static) if long transcodes still cut off.

Like the headers preset, streaming is managed only through the route form for local HTTP routes; API, agent and other saves leave the transport untouched.

## Multiple backends and load balancing

An HTTP, TCP, or UDP route can point at more than one backend. Click **Add backend** under the target fields to add another server; Traefik load-balances across them (`loadBalancer.servers`). Route cards show a **+N** badge when a route has more than one backend.

For HTTP routes, the **Load balancing** section adds:

| Option | Writes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sticky sessions | `loadBalancer.sticky.cookie` | Pins a client to one backend via a cookie. Cookie name, `secure` and `httpOnly` are optional. |
| Health check | `loadBalancer.healthCheck` | Path is required; interval and timeout accept Go durations (`10s`, `500ms`). A bare number is read as seconds. |
| Router priority | `router.priority` | Higher wins when several routers match the same request. Negative values are allowed, which is how you make a wildcard catchall lose against every explicit route. `0` means unset and is not written. Also available for TCP routes. |

These round-trip on edit, so reopening a route shows the backends and settings it already has.

Every route needs at least one backend host. A save that does not supply one is rejected rather than written, so a route can never end up pointing at an empty address.

::: tip Older clients are safe
The mobile app and older cached pages post only a single target. Saving from one of those updates the first backend only - additional backends, sticky sessions, health checks, and priority are preserved rather than wiped.
:::

## Shared services

Several routers can point at the same service - a native Traefik pattern, useful when the same backend needs different middlewares per hostname (an internal name with no auth and an external one behind Authelia, for example) or when one edge Traefik fans multiple domains into the same downstream instance (#125).

Switch the **Backend** toggle in the route form to **Existing service** and pick any service from your config files. The route then writes only a router with `service: <name>`; the service block is never created, modified, or deleted by that route. The picker lists file-provider services for the active server across all config files.

Behavior worth knowing:

- Deleting or disabling a route never removes a service another router still references.
- Deleting the route that originally created a shared service keeps the service as long as another router points at it.
- Editing a route that references a shared service keeps the reference; backends, sticky sessions and health checks are managed where the service is defined - through the route that owns it, or in YAML.
- Older clients (the mobile app, cached pages) editing a referenced route cannot accidentally convert it into an owned service - the reference is preserved server-side.
- Hand-written cross-provider references such as `service: whoami@docker` are preserved on edit, but the picker does not create them.

## Deleting a route

Click the trash icon on the route card. The corresponding service entry in `dynamic.yml` is removed automatically.

## Entrypoint middlewares

When `STATIC_CONFIG_PATH` is set, traefik-manager reads `entryPoints[name].http.middlewares` from the static config and shows those middlewares as grey **ep** chips on route cards - one chip per middleware inherited from a matched entry point. Hovering the chip shows "Applied via entrypoint". These are read-only and managed in the static config, not the dynamic config.

## Bulk actions

Click the **selection icon** in the filter bar to enter bulk mode. Each route card shows a checkbox - tick the ones you want to act on. A sticky action bar appears at the bottom with:

- **Enable** - enables all selected routes
- **Disable** - disables all selected routes
- **Delete** - deletes all selected routes after a confirmation prompt

Click the X in the action bar or the selection button again to exit bulk mode.

## Enabling and disabling routes

Each route card has a toggle icon (green when active, grey when inactive). Clicking it:

- **Disable** - removes the router and service from `dynamic.yml` (Traefik immediately stops routing traffic) and saves the full config in `manager.yml`. The card is greyed out.
- **Enable** - restores the router and service to `dynamic.yml`. Traefik picks it up instantly.

A backup is created before each toggle operation. Disabled routes persist across restarts.

## Backups

A backup of `dynamic.yml` is created automatically before every create, edit, delete, or toggle operation. Access backups via **Settings → Backups**.

## How it works

Routes are stored in Traefik dynamic config files (the file provider config). traefik-manager reads and writes these files directly using `ruamel.yaml` to preserve comments and formatting. When multiple config files are mounted, each route card shows a small badge with its source file. The Routes tab shows the combined list from all config files plus live status from the Traefik API.

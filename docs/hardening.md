# Traefik Security Hardening

Traefik Manager can configure several Traefik security controls from the UI. This page explains what they defend against and how to enable them. These harden **Traefik and your backends** - they are separate from [Traefik Manager's own security](security.md).

All of them apply to the Host and to remote agents: the Static Config editor and the middleware wizards work the same for both.

## Header alias spoofing (underscore headers)

### The problem

Go - and therefore Traefik - treats `X-Auth-User` and `X_Auth_User` as two **different** headers. A forwardAuth middleware manages the dash form (`X-Auth-User`), but an attacker-supplied underscore variant (`X_Auth_User`) passes through untouched.

It becomes exploitable at the backend: CGI, WSGI (Python), PHP, and some application-server setups collapse both forms into the same variable (`HTTP_X_AUTH_USER`). The app can then read the attacker's `X_Auth_User` instead of the identity your auth server set - an authentication bypass behind an otherwise correct forwardAuth setup (Authelia, Authentik, Gatekeeper, etc.).

### The fix: `underscoreHeadersStrategy`

Traefik added an entry point option (**Traefik 3.6.20 / 3.7.6 or newer**) that controls underscore headers before routing:

| Strategy | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `keep` | Forward underscore headers as-is (Traefik default). |
| `delete` | Silently strip any request header whose name contains an underscore. **Recommended.** |
| `reject` | Reject any request carrying an underscore header with `400 Bad Request`. |

**In Traefik Manager:** open **Static Config → Entrypoints**, edit the entry point that handles your external HTTPS traffic, and set **Underscore Headers** to `Delete` (or `Reject`). The option is written to whichever entry point you edit, and only offered when the running Traefik version supports it.

The entry point name is whatever you called it - `websecure`, `https`, `web`, etc. Using `websecure` as an example, it writes:

```yaml
entryPoints:
  websecure:   # your external HTTPS entry point, whatever its name
    address: ":443"
    http:
      underscoreHeadersStrategy: delete
```

If you use the forwardAuth wizards, enabling this is strongly recommended.

### Related: CVE-2026-39858

A separate but related flaw (**CVE-2026-39858**, CVSS 7.8) let underscore aliases of *forwarded* headers (e.g. `X_Forwarded_Proto`) bypass ForwardAuth entirely. This one is fixed only by **upgrading Traefik** to **2.11.43 / 3.6.14 / 3.7.0-rc.2 or newer**. Traefik Manager warns you when your running Traefik is affected.

## Encoded path characters

Ambiguous percent-encoded characters in a request path (e.g. `%2F` for `/`, `%2E` for `.`) can be used to sneak past path-based routing or access controls. Traefik sanitizes paths by default since 3.3.6 (removing `..`, `.`, and duplicate slashes), but rejecting ambiguous encoded characters is opt-in.

**Traefik 3.7+** provides an `encodedCharacters` middleware. Add it from **Add Middleware** - template **Encoded Characters** - and attach it to sensitive routes. Every character is rejected by default; tick one only if a backend genuinely needs it.

---

## ForwardAuth response size limit

A compromised or misbehaving auth server could return a very large response body to the forwardAuth subrequest. **Traefik 3.7+** adds `maxResponseBodySize` to cap it. The forwardAuth wizards (including Authentik, Authelia, and Gatekeeper) expose it as **Max Response Body Size** - set a small limit in bytes (a few KB) since auth responses are tiny.

## Traefik security advisories

Traefik Manager checks your running Traefik version against a list of known security advisories and shows a warning when your Traefik is affected - with extra urgency when a forwardAuth middleware is configured, since those are the most exposed. Keep Traefik updated; the update-available badge in the navbar shows when a newer Traefik is out.

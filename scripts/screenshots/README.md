# Screenshot rig

Recaptures every desktop screenshot for the docs and README from a seeded
demo environment, in both themes, at 1920x1080 in the Modern layout, which uses the full frame.

```bash
scripts/screenshots/run.sh                 # shoot ghcr.io/chr0nzz/traefik-manager:beta
scripts/screenshots/run.sh ghcr.io/chr0nzz/traefik-manager:latest
scripts/screenshots/run.sh --setup         # also retake the setup wizard pages
scripts/screenshots/run.sh --login         # also retake the login page
scripts/screenshots/run.sh --auth          # both of the above
```

The setup wizard and login page are skipped by default - their screenshots
rarely change, and each needs its own app restart with different settings.
Pass `--setup`, `--login` or `--auth` to retake them.

What it does:

1. Seeds demo data: 20 routes named after real apps (so dashboard groups and
   icons resolve), middlewares, multi-backend/TCP/UDP/shared-service examples,
   a weighted and a mirroring service (one of them managed by Traefik Manager,
   so the ownership and edit paths are shot), six self-signed certificates with
   staggered expiries, and a generated JSON access log (`gen_data.py`).
2. Boots Traefik v3.6 + Traefik Manager on a private docker network so live
   stats, entry points and router status are real. Traefik gets a copy of the
   dynamic config without `certResolver` so no router shows an ACME error.
3. Logs in through the real login page (password `screenshots`) and drives
   headless Chrome through every tab, view mode, modal and settings panel in
   dark and light (`capture.mjs` - 38 views per theme).
4. Resizes to 1920x1080, installs into `docs/public/images/` under the
   existing names, and rebuilds both README carousel GIFs
   (`install_images.py`).

Not covered: all mobile screenshots. Everything runs in throwaway containers
and a temp dir; review the git diff before committing.
